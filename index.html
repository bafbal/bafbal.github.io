        <h1>Baffi Bálint</h1>
        <p>my name is, and I am in the job seeking period after having cleared the <strong>Junior Software Developer
            </strong> course at <strong>Green Fox Academy</strong> specialized in <strong>Java backend
                development.</strong> This is my personal webpage aiming to introduce myself and showcase my skills by
            presenting my individual work.</p>

        <h2 id="progbasics">Backend project</h2>
        <p>During the last six weeks of the course we were working on a project in a team of 3. Our project was to
            create a <strong>web application that lets its users send feedback to each other and analyze their
                data.</strong></p>
        <p>To present the used technologies and app features, let me paste two snippets from our final presentation</p>

        <img src="assets/project/timeline.jpg" alt="timeline">
        <p>Among the three of us <strong>it was my particular job</strong> to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <strong>
                <li>Set up environment (dotenv)</li>
                <li>Add authentication (Spring security)</li>
                <li>Configure GitHub Actions</li>
                <li>Implement global exception handling</li>
                <li>Implement user registration verification mail feature</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>My individual project</strong> is having similar features and currently under construction. You can

        <h2 id="progbasics">About the course</h2>
        <p>I started Green Fox Academy backend developer course in March 2022 and I successfully cleared my exam in
            August. During these four and a half months I acquried a large variety of hard and soft skills that are
            indispensable for a software developer. Regarding the technical side, <strong>the technologies I used are
                shown below on the certificate and figured in the above project description.</strong></p>
        <p>However, it was not only my programming knowledge that I broadened during this course. Over the last 6 weeks
            we were working on projects in teams of 3-4 developers. There our mentors tried to simulate a real working
            environment as much as possible. Below are <strong>my main takeaways</strong> from this very illuminating
            period:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I got the feeling of <strong>working together with other developers.</strong> We were issuing pull
                requests, reviewed the others' code, competing with each other to finish earlier so that it is not us
                who have to solve merge conflicts...:)</li>
            <li>We split the duration of the project into six <strong>sprints.</strong> We had to make a decision every
                Monday <strong>which and how much issues we claim to finish</strong> until end of the week. It was a
                good experience to see that usually issues were finished 1-2 days after the first version was ready for
                peer review.</li>
            <li><strong>Tests</strong>... Honestly speaking, I did not feel exactly why we need tests until we started
                this project. But I was stunned to see how fast it grew and became impossible to tell whether everything
                works fine or not. Now I like writing tests and I make sure that <strong>I write them immediately after
                    I finished coding the logic</strong> - the test left for next day or week will probably never be
                written... </li>
            <li>Finally, I learnt a lot about myself. As I described in the ABOUT section, I partially chose this
                careerpath to get a better opportunity for a proper work-life balance. However, I soon experienced that
                this kind of trade can be pursued essentially 24/7 that certainly cannot be called as "proper work-life
                balance". It took me a while to experience <strong>how much I can take depending on my present
                    condition, how many short nights I can make before I must sleep properly, in which phase of the day
                    I am effective and not, how much I can code without losing my interest</strong> etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="progbasics">Algorithmic exercises</h2>
        <p>Algoritmic exercises are significant and indispensable part of my daily routine as a programmer. They keep my
            routine of Java "in my hand" and offer a great opportunity for personal development. I especially love the
            site CodeWars, there I was already able to learn a lot (about Java streams for example) checking out other
            programmers' solutions. I find especially one-liner stream and regex solutions really inspiring.</p>
        <p>While earlier I completed this tasks the way I could on my own and by heart and as fast as possible
            (preparing for Green Fox Academy final exam entry), recently I think about what I need and research it. This
            way I gradually improve myself for example regarding streams and regex. <strong>For the whole list of my
                solutions check out my GitHub repository.</strong> Below is one of my recent (2022/09/05) solution, one
            of my first one-liners. This code returns a boolean depending on whether array b contains precisely the
            squares of a in voluntary order.</p>

        <h2 id="progbasics">Programming basics</h2>
        <p>I wrote these programs at the beginning of the training. Although they certainly do not reflect the way I
            code today after having cleared the bootcamp and many coding challenges on Hackerrank and Codewars I still
            find it important to show these pieces of work because my genuine passion for programming is very well
            expressed by them.</p>
        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <h4>Snake</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/snake/screenshot_resized.png" alt="Screenshot from snake game">
        <p>I created a multiplayer implementation of the popular game. It is fun to play it so that it occupied my son
            for half an hour - I can call it my first not self-purposed code. At that time it was my most
            object-oriented code.</p>
        <a href="pb_oop_snake.html">UML</a>
        <h3>ALgorithms, structures</h3>
        <h4>Create a random map for a game</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/randommap/screenshot.png"
            alt="Screenshot of a matrix representing a random generated map">
        <p>Walls are represented by "3"-s and available areas by zeros in the above matrix. Task: put down x walls on an
            mxn map randomly in such way that any available field can be reached from any.</p>

        <img src="assets/progbasics/sierpinski/screenshot_resized.png" alt="Sierpinski carpet">
        <p>After landing a recursion code successfully in the minesweeper game I felt it was high time to create a
            fractal. It ended up pretty well packed.</p>

        <h4>Minesweeper</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/minesweeper/screenshot.png" alt="lost game">
        <img src="assets/progbasics/minesweeper/screenshot2 (3).png" alt="won game">
        <p>Although it seemed to be easy from OOP point of view, while coding the expansion of zero fields I managed to
            implement such delicacies as four times nested iteration, XOR operator, recursion.</p>
        <a href="pb_minesweeper.html">code about above delicacies</a>
        <h4>Tic-tac-toe</h4>

        <img src="assets/progbasics/tictactoe/screenshot_humanWins.png" alt="human wins">
        <p>Computer finds moves based on following priorities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Wins in one move</li>
            <li>2) Prevents human to win in one move</li>
            <li>3) Select a random move.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disclaimer: I coded this the very evening we learned about OOP concept. Of course it could be done in a much
            more decent way, but I leave it here as a good memory :)</p>
