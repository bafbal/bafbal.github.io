        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Bálint Baffi and I graduated as MSc Chemical Engineer. I have 10 years of experience as process engineer at multinational companies. My life was completely OK, I was appreciated and had a good salary, could have worked there till I retire. However, I could not help the feeling of lacking certain things. I wanted such work that gives me the feeling of the flow and the reward of creation while offering a steep learning curve. I also felt the need for more liberty in terms of fine-tuning my work-life balance. For these reasons I decided to change careerpath and become a software developer. My interest for IT did not come out of the blue. In my childhood among many other electric circuits I crafted DIY amplifiers and loudspeakers for my own purpose with the help of my father. I would call it the first hacking activity in my life. The first programming language I learned was Comenius Logo. Later on I get acquainted with Turbo Pascal, C++, Matlab at University. I always enjoyed these activities. So I hope with all my heart that I am giving the right answer to the question "Could my life be even better?" that I asked myself in early 2022.</p>
