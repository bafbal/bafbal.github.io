        <h1>Baffi Bálint</h1>
        <p>my name is, and I am in the job seeking period after having cleared the <strong>Junior Software Developer </strong> course at <strong>Green Fox Academy</strong> specialized in <strong>Java backend development.</strong> This is my personal webpage aiming to introduce myself and showcase my skills by presenting my individual work.</p>

        <h2 id="progbasics">Algorithmic exercises</h2>
        <p>Algoritmic exercises are significant and indispensable part of my daily routine as a programmer. They keep my routine of Java "in my hand" and offer a great opportunity for personal development. I especially love the site CodeWars, there I was already able to learn a lot (about Java streams for example) checking out other programmers' solutions. I find especially one-liner stream and regex solutions really inspiring.</p>
        <p>While earlier I completed this tasks the way I could on my own and by heart and as fast as possible (preparing for Green Fox Academy final exam entry), recently I think about what I need and research it. This way I gradually improve myself for example regarding streams and regex. For the whole list of my solutions check out my GitHub repository. Below is one of my recent (2022/09/05) solution, one of my first one-liners. This code returns a boolean depending on whether array b contains precisely the squares of a in voluntary order.</p>

        <h2 id="progbasics">Programming basics</h2>
        <p>I wrote these programs at the beginning of the training. Although they certainly do not reflect the way I code today after having cleared the bootcamp and many coding challenges on Hackerrank and Codewars I still find it important to show these pieces of work because my genuine passion for programming is very well expressed by them.</p>
        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <h4>Snake</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/snake/screenshot_resized.png" alt="Screenshot from snake game">
        <p>I created a multiplayer implementation of the popular game. It is fun to play it so that it occupied my son for half an hour - I can call it my first not self-purposed code. At that time it was my most object-oriented code.</p>
        <a href="pb_oop_snake.html">UML</a>
        <h3>ALgorithms, structures</h3>
        <h4>Create a random map for a game</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/randommap/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of a matrix representing a random generated map">
        <p>Walls are represented by "3"-s and available areas by zeros in the above matrix. Task: put down x walls on an mxn map randomly in such way that any available field can be reached from any.</p>
        <a href="pb_randommap.html">code of recursive algorithm, the cycle splitting it up and the main code itself</a>
        <h4>Sierpinski carpet</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/sierpinski/screenshot_resized.png" alt="Sierpinski carpet">
        <p>After landing a recursion code successfully in the minesweeper game I felt it was high time to create a fractal. It ended up pretty well packed.</p>
        <a href="pb_sierpinski.html">kód</a>
        <h4>Minesweeper</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/minesweeper/screenshot.png" alt="lost game">
        <img src="assets/progbasics/minesweeper/screenshot2 (3).png" alt="won game">
        <p>Although it seemed to be easy from OOP point of view, while coding the expansion of zero fields I managed to implement such delicacies as four times nested iteration, XOR operator, recursion.</p>
        <a href="pb_minesweeper.html">code about above delicacies</a>
        <h4>Tic-tac-toe</h4>
        <img src="assets/progbasics/tictactoe/screenshot_machineWins.png" alt="computer wins">
        <img src="assets/progbasics/tictactoe/screenshot_humanWins.png" alt="human wins">
        <p>Computer finds moves based on following priorities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Wins in one move</li>
            <li>2) Prevents human to win in one move</li>
            <li>3) Select a random move.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disclaimer: I coded this the very evening we learned about OOP concept. Of course it could be done in a much more decent way, but I leave it here as a good memory :)</p>
